                            <p>Ah. Small wonder then, that they contrived this curse.</p>
                            <p>It kills softly, slowly, quietly. It drains my life second by second. A rogue darkness creeping over vibrant life unnoticed, like the first shift of shadows on a long summers…</p>
                            <p>What chance, then, for the cursed warrior to reach Valhalla? This trickling death would leave me drained of all aspiration, of verve, of all chance for glory—survivor of a thousand battles, laid to rest in his own bed.</p>
                            <p>It is late now, these summer shadows seem longer in their sloth, the far reaching fingers of this ugly thing wrap round my soul, clutching, dragging the veil across my eyes.</p>

                            <p>Fine. Fitting.</p>

                            <p>These half-blind hours, colored with painful remorse and sudden, brutal aches of creeping doom, I have filled with research. A fire of knowledge such as I have never lit before, and further, a system of mysteries devious enough to confound the possessed house itself.</p>

                        <p>Dr. William J. S. Morosely, adventurer and explorer, sent you and seven other notable curse breakers, veil piercers, and demon hunters invitations to join him at his home for dinner and a battle for riches.</p>
                        
                        <p>Morosely's fascination with the occult and mysterious led him through a rabbit-warren of unsavory, haunted places. He ventured, he wrote, he lectured, he taught, and, eventually, he retired comfortably and quietly to his Raleigh home.</p>
                        
                        <p>A year ago, he began to notice strange whispers and hair-raising moments of discomfiture waking around his home. Enlivened by the new mystery so interwoven with his own life, he dove into research of the phenomenon.</p>
                        
                        <p>Months ago, he started to see faces moving behind mirrors and skeletal figures creeping beneath his freshly painted walls. A creeping malaise settled into his muscles and bones, far faster than the simple indignities of age. The house drained him. His research led him to a cursed object in his home and an ancient text that might offer hope.</p>

                    <p>Three weeks ago, he applied learnings from the grimoire to develop a counter-curse. Hours later, Morosely found the book in the embers of his dining room fire. Dismayed and disoriented, he climbed the stairs to his bedroom, rubbing at his face, deep in thought. A skeletal hand snapped out from the wall and clawed his arm. Blood splattered the wall and dripped from his arm... then disappeared into the paint and floor boards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Two weeks ago, he tried to leave the house and could not. Immediately, Morosely made a morbid decision. He would not survive this encounter. He secreted pieces of the counter-curse around his home, devising a system of brutally challenging clues to hide them from the house, even as it sucked his life force away.</p>
                    
                    <p>He sat down one morning and began to write, penning letters to individuals he thought may be equal to the task of destroying the curse in his home.</p>
